## Overview
This is a github-deployed website containing a basic portfolio of my web developement work to date. I am currently working through a coding bootcamp at the University of New Hampshire. As an aside, they *weren't kidding* about the bootcamp part. It has been a ton of new technology learning fast and furious. It has been a lot of hard work but very rewarding. The support network -- Instructor, TA's, and Student Success Manager -- have been amazing. And, it's been great getting to know my fellow cohort members as we have worked through class exercises, assignments, and group projects.
